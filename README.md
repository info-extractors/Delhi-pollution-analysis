Convert this into readme file : Delhi Air Pollution Analysis and Prediction
1. Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive data analysis on the air quality of Delhi. The primary goals are to identify the pollutants that most significantly impact the Air Quality Index (AQI), understand seasonal and weekly patterns in pollution levels, and build a machine learning model to accurately predict the AQI.

2. Key Findings & Insights
Our analysis uncovered several key patterns in Delhi's air pollution:

Seasonal Trend: There is a distinct cyclical trend in air quality. The AQI is highest during the winter months (January and December) and significantly improves during the mid-year months.

Primary Pollutants: The correlation analysis revealed that specific pollutants are the main drivers of high AQI values:

PM2.5 and PM10 have the strongest correlation with AQI (approx. 0.90 and 0.80, respectively).

Carbon Monoxide (CO) is another major contributor, with a high correlation of approximately 0.70.

Predictive Model Performance: A Random Forest Regressor model was trained to predict the AQI.

The model achieved a high R² score of 92.2%, indicating it can explain the vast majority of the variance in the AQI.

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was 31.05, which is low relative to the data's standard deviation, confirming that the model effectively captures the underlying patterns.

3. Dataset
The dataset contains daily air quality measurements for the Delhi region. The columns include:

Date, Month, Year

Holidays_Count: Number of holidays on a given day.

Days: Day of the week (encoded numerically).

Pollutant concentrations: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, Ozone

AQI: The overall Air Quality Index (target variable).

4. Methodology
The analysis was conducted in several stages:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Loaded the dataset, handled data types, and engineered new features like Day_Name and PM2.5_to_PM10_Ratio.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Calculated descriptive statistics and performed a correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.

Visualization: Created various plots (heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts, and time series plots) to visualize trends, including weekday vs. weekend effects and the impact of holidays.

Predictive Modeling: Trained a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the AQI based on pollutant concentrations and evaluated its performance using the R² score and RMSE.

5. Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
